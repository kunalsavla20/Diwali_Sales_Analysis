# Diwali_Sales_Analysis

# Project Overview

The "Diwali Sales Analysis" project is an exploration of sales data during the Diwali season, focusing on understanding purchasing trends and sales performance on the basis of different categories. Leveraging the power of Python and the Pandas library, this project aims to extract valuable insights from Diwali sales data and provide a data-driven perspective on this festive season.

# Project Outline

1. Analyze Diwali season sales data to extract insights for enhancing future festive season strategies.
2. Detect and understand trends and patterns to guide future planning for festive seasons.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In this project, I harnessed the power of Pandas, a versatile Python library, to meticulously clean and preprocess our raw data. Data cleaning and preprocessing are foundational steps in any data analysis project, as they ensure that the data is in a suitable form for meaningful analysis and insights.

1. Handling Missing Data:

  Dealing with missing data is a critical aspect of data preprocessing. Using Pandas, I identified missing values within the dataset and employed strategies such as imputation or removal to address these gaps. This step helped enhance the completeness and reliability of the data.
